Bluetooth API
========================

Blue Dot also contains a useful API ``bluedot.btcomm`` for sending and receiving data over Bluetooth. 

For normal use of Blue Dot, this API doesn't need to be used, but its included in the documentation for info and for those who might need a simple Bluetooth communication library.
